# AdFlowHQ

AdFlowHQ is a multi-tenant, AI-enabled workflow orchestration platform built on Temporal (Go SDK), designed for automating lead journeys across Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and CallRail. It supports smart decision-making using AI agents and offers tenant-specific control via a modern React UI.

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🧩 **Workflow Orchestration** – Powered by Temporal.io with pluggable activities
- 👥 **Multi-Tenant SaaS** – Each client (tenant) has isolated data and workflows
- 🤖 **AI Agent Collaboration** – Integrate Gemini API to enrich workflows with intent analysis and smart routing
- 🔐 **Secure Secret Management** – Uses HashiCorp Vault (POC) and AWS Secrets Manager (Prod)
- 📊 **FinOps Ready** – Track and enforce cost policies per tenant and workflow
- 📞 **Marketing Integrations**
  - Google Ads: Conversion upload, audience updates
  - Facebook Ads: Lead syncing, pixel events
  - CallRail: Call tracking and lead attribution
- 🌐 **React Frontend** – Workflow management UI per tenant

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Go + Temporal SDK
- **Frontend:** React + Vite
- **Database:** SQLite (POC), PostgreSQL (AWS RDS for prod)
- **Secrets:** Vault (local), AWS Secrets Manager (prod)
- **AI Agent:** Gemini API (optional in workflows)

📁 Breakdown of Key Folders
	•	activities/: External API integrations for ads platforms and CallRail.
	•	agent/: AI agent logic using Gemini API — will include prompts, tool invocations, and callbacks to workflows.
	•	workflows/:
	•	orchestrator.go defines the main workflow that triggers AI analysis, decision-making, and subsequent child workflows.
	•	child_tasks.go contains sub-workflows or activities dedicated to ads sync, call attribution, etc.
	•	worker/main.go:
	•	Initializes Temporal Client, sets namespace and task queue, registers workflows & activities, starts polling.
	•	client/main.go:
	•	CLI tool to start a workflow with given tenant/context (e.g. go run client/main.go --tenant=acme), useful for demo purposes.
	•	config/:
	•	Loads config from env/Vault, including Gemini API key, Temporal server URL, secrets path.
	•	vault/:
	•	Docker Compose to run Vault locally; stores Gemini credentials and ads platform secrets.
	•	ui/:
	•	React app scaffolded via Vite. Will query Temporal workflows via CLI or HTTP shim for signals and status polling.
	•	tests/:
	•	Unit tests for workflows using github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/testsuite, mocking activities and the AI agent responses.  

## 🔧 Getting Started (POC)

1. Clone the repo and start services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   go run backend/main.go
   go run worker/main.go
   ```


📌 Roadmap
